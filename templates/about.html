    <p><h5>Dress: </h5> Lounge Suit for men and cocktail for ladies</p>
    <p><h5>Kids and Pets:</h5> Due to the size of the venue we respectfully ask that no children attend. The venue is in a National Park which means that no animals are allowed (except party animals) </p>
    <p><h5>Getting there and Away:</h5> Athol Hall is down near Taronga Zoo in Mosman in a National Park near a residential area. There are a few ways to get there and it depends where you are coming from:
        <li><a href="https://transportnsw.info/documents/timetables/93-F2-Taronga-Zoo-20201025.pdf" target = "_blank">From the CBD: The Ferry</a> to the zoo is the way to go with a short (10 min walk) to the venue. A taxi from the CBD will cost around $45</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.myfastferry.com.au/manly-fast-ferry/manly-circular-quay/" target = "_blank">From Manly: Unfortunately the Ferry</a> doesn't go from Manly to the Zoo so you'll have to go to the city and get a ferry back to the Zoo and walk (10 mins). A taxi from Manly will cost $50</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.nationalparks.nsw.gov.au/venues/athol-hall/venue-info" target ="_blank">Driving: There is limited Parking </a>near the venue, it is metered parking in the national park</li>
        <li>Getting Away: An Uber or Taxi will is the best bet at the end of the night - it's a loooooong walk home from there....</li></p>
    <p><h5>Online Link:</h5> A zoom style link to view the wedding will be provided closer to the day for those that can't join us.</p>
