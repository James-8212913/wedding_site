      <p>The story of Anél and James has been one of love and adventure. After meeting over a coffee late in 2017 they've not spent much time apart. The time together has been characterised by good food and wine, dad jokes and adventures of all shapes and sizes.</p>
      <p>There have been plenty of multi-day hikes where James was lucky enough to pass the first 'hiking' test. James has also lost a few bets along the way - drop bears were proven to be a real thing.</p>
      <p>Anél has taken James to South Africa where Charl showed James a thing or two about doing a braai and Una gave both Anél and James a masterclass in how to cook rusks. Schalk still claims he was the first family to meet James. Anél was lucky enough to share a chardonay with Karen in Queensland and attend the Christmas Party. </p>
      <p>In a relatively short period of time there have been plenty of life events, some bigger than others. Anél's first game of AFL was at the SCG where the swans managed a win under lights on a cold winters evening and James has been lucky enough to judge the annual Potjie competition.</p>
      <p>The marriage of Anél and James will no doubt be as much fun and as adventurous as the first few years have been. Fingers are crossed for eveyone being able to travel again in the near future where Anél and James look forward to spending the day with friends and family from far and wide. </p>
